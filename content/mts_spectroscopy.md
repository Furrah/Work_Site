The MTS Spectroscopy system was developed in the Imaging Systems Department (ISD) at RAL Space. The basic principle is to lock a laser to a resonance of Rubidium 85/87 and then offset lock multiple lasers from the master lock. The system below has been designed to fit in a standard cubesat format for use in cold atoms research in space.
